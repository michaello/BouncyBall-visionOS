# BouncyBall - RealityKit Physics Demo for visionOS

A sample visionOS app demonstrating RealityKit physics with adjustable parameters, created as a reference for Apple Developer Forums discussions about bouncing ball physics.

## Overview

This project showcases how to implement realistic ball physics in RealityKit for Vision Pro, addressing common issues with energy loss during bounces. It provides real-time control over physics parameters through an interactive ornament interface.
